# Haversack: a Digital Character Sheet for D&D 5e

*Legendary Item, Rare*

Haversack is made to be a player's main Dungeons & Dragons utility: character sheet, dice roller, journal, spellbook, SRD reference, inventory, and encounter tracker all in one. Let this utility handle the math and logic of managing a D&D character, so you can focus on the creative and role-play elements of the game. Spend less time trying to remember the bonuses to add to an attack while in rage, how many ki points a flurry-of-blows costs, or why that NPC's name seems so familiar.

Haversack is not meant to turn D&D into a video game. That's what *Baldur's Gate* is for. Instead, it's supposed to be an easy, organized replacement for all of the tools you may need during a game. It's your character sheet, journal, *Player's Handbook*, and anything else you might need. You can use any combination of Haversack's tools as you like. You can just use it to help level characters up and track spell slots, or you can run your entire character through it, if you want!

The main purpose of this program is as a learning project for me. Hi! I'm Ryan! I'm a relatively new programmer and D&D player, and I'm using this as a project to explore a bit of desktop application development. I'm keeping a devlog as I go, so if you want to follow along as I work, check it out!

Haversack is very early in development, and I'm very early in my dev career, so I can make no promises as to the completeness or stability of this program. The code is provided as-is, with no warranty, and I can't guarantee I will be able to address any specific issues or requests. However, PRs are welcome, as is feedback or advice!
