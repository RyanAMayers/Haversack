# Haversack Devlog: 2

So I've started learning C++. So far, I've just done some basic stuff, like a "Hello World" and some little demos like that. The biggest thing was a class for a D&D coinpurse, that can greedy-sort money and has a few methods. I wrote something similar in C (that's actually the only C experience I have, I just did thta as a curiosity project), so this was just a port, but I wanted to specifically make it a class so I could learn about the C++ way of doing things. It's not too bad so far, but I still hear horror stories from everyone or warnings about how it's unusual or how there are a lot of pitfalls. Some of the things I've learned so far:

- One common piece of advice I've heard is not to code in C++ like it's C. There are a lot of features that C++ has that are more recommended to use, and if you just write C, there's no point to use C++. I think people use vectors vs arrays as an example of this?
- Namespaces and scope are going to be important to learn early on. I want to separate things out and write in a modular way (maybe a habit I picked up from JS and Go), so that will be a good skill to get early.
- Classes seem pretty understandable, but I think there might be more trouble when I start to implement inheritance and get three or four child-classes deep. Still, I already have some ideas for how that will be useful (for example, a root class for Creature that can be extended into Hero, Enemy, etc)
- C++ does not have its own package manager. I don't know if this will be a huge deal, but I'm very used to things like Pip and NPM, and I wonder if this will affect my experience or not.
- I kind of got the hang of pointers for Go, but now there's another kind of pointer??? What even is a smart pointer?
- In the same vein, memory management is going to be a fun thing to learn.

Next, I think I'm going to try to remake some of my dice-rolling functions.
