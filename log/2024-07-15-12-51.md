# Haversack Devlog: 1

So I have a plan for this project now. I think.

A lot of the main motivation for the project and my goals are in the readme (as of commit 46dbb66), but the basic version is this: I want to make a digital character sheet and reference tool for Dungeons & Dragons 5e players. This should help you level your character up, see your stats, quickly calculate roll bonuses, etc. and just make playing the game easier.

I'm starting this project as a way to learn more about desktop app development and try something different. I'm a pretty new developer, having started my first dev job about six months ago. I work in web development, and my experience is mostly in Javascript and Golang. I also have a bit of basic Python experience from when I first started exploring coding in college.

This is actually, technically, my third attempt to create Haversack. I started the project as part of that Python exploration, but ended up shelving it after not too long. A couple weeks ago I picked it back up, using some of the new Golang I had been learning. I made some progress, and outlined a plan for the program, but I've decided to start over, because I don't know if Golang is the best choice for this project. I'm sure I could do it, but there are a few reasons I've switched away.

So, now, I'm trying again. This time, I'm going with a language I've never tried, but which I think should be well-suited to this project. My thoughts were:

- **Object-Oriented**: When I was working on the Golang version of this, I missed having the option to use classes and inheritance. One of the first things I worked on was player classes, and my first thought was to define a parent class for, uh, player class (that might get confusing), and then define each specific player class to inherit that main one, and so on for subclasses. So, for example, the parent class would be `PlayerClass`, which would be extended by `Barbarian`, which itself is extended by `Berserker`. Go is pretty great, but in this specific project, I missed having classes.

- **Well-Suited to Desktop UI Apps**: I don't know a whole lot about desktop UI development, but I know that there are a few common frameworks that you can use. I'm developing on Linux, and I know the two big UI frameworks for Linux apps are GTK and Qt. I picked Qt, somewhat arbitrarily, but I did know that it's cross-platform, which is good because I'd like this app to be useful to (or at least testable by) others on Windows and MacOS. I had found a package of Qt bindings for Go, which I liked better than using a more specific Go UI library because it'll help me learn something more transferrable.

- **Not Electron**: I want to avoid Electron for this, because the point was to learn something new and make a desktop app, and not to make a D&D website. Plus, I'd like this app to be a little lighter than that, to make it more portable and accessible.

- **New to Me**: I want to branch out and try something I haven't yet! I want to learn something new that I wouldn't be learning otherwise. It'll probably be frustrating at first, but it'll get easier as I go on, and then I'll have a new skill.

All of these thoughts led me to **C++**. I've heard some horror stories (like that quote about shooting your foot in C or blowing off your leg in C++), but I also know it's used a lot, especially for desktop applications. It's also already closely tied to Qt, so that will hopefully make the UI work more straightforward, or at least more researchable. I've been curious about C in general, so this will let me learn a bit more about that family of languages, use some of the skills I've picked up in Golang, and work in a language well-suited to my specific project.

I've been interested in learning C for a while, and I know there are a lot of differences between that and C++, but it feels like a step in the right direction. I'm sure it can't be as bad as everyone says.
